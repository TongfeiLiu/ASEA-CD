# ASEA-CD

# Description
This code refered to our proposed Adaptive Spatial-context Extraction Algoirhtm (ASEA)  which is used to generate the change magnitude image (CMI) with very high spatial resolution.
After obtaining CMI, double-window flexible pace search (DFPS) or Otsu can be adopted to achieve binary change detection map.
